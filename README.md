## Educational Approach

Chord Lab uses a progressive learning methodology:

1. **Proper Foundation**: Start with correct posture and hand positioning
2. **Visual Learning**: See exactly where fingers go with clear diagrams
3. **Audio Reinforcement**: Hear what chords should sound like
4. **Muscle Memory**: Practice chord transitions and progressions
5. **Real Application**: Learn chords used in actual songs

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 with hooks and functional components
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
