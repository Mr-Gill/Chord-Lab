## Build Instructions (for teachers/developers)

If you want to generate the single-file version locally from source:

1. Install dependencies (one-time):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Build the standalone HTML (outputs at project root as chord-lab-standalone.html):
   ```bash
   npm run build:standalone
   ```
3. Distribute `chord-lab-standalone.html` to students. They can doubleâ€‘click it to open offline. External links (e.g., help pages, YouTube) will open in a browser if internet is available, but the core app works offline.
