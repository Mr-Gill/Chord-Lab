# Branch Consolidation Analysis - README

This directory contains analysis and documentation for consolidating the Chord Lab repository branches.

## Files Generated

### Analysis Documentation
- **`REPOSITORY_STATUS_REPORT.md`** - Executive summary of findings and immediate actions needed
- **`CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md`** - Detailed implementation plan for repository consolidation

### Automation Scripts  
- **`cleanup_branches.sh`** - Script to safely delete merged branches (run AFTER manual merges)

## Key Finding

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: The main branch is incomplete and contains only 1 commit. All application functionality exists in 45 feature branches that need to be consolidated, not deleted.

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Merge PR #121** (testing improvements)
2. **Merge PRs #120, #119, #118** (chord diagram improvements)  
3. **Evaluate `feat/practice-enhancements`** (232 commits, likely main app)
4. **Then** run cleanup script to remove merged branches

## Repository Owner Next Steps

See `REPOSITORY_STATUS_REPORT.md` for detailed immediate actions.
